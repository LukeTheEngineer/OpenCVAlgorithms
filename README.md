# RenderingPipelines

A project utilizing the OpenCV library and **optionally** FunctionalPlus

Each function within the **ImageProcessing** header applies certain details to whatever images.

As of now the current functions inside ImageProcessing.h  are: 

**BrightnessAlgorithm** - This function detects shadows and other dark areas in images and brightens them to produce a desired result.

**EnhanceImage** - This function uses smoothing and rounding (sigma_s, & sigma_r) to produce an enhance image.

**EditImage** - This function uses brightness & contrast to deliver a basic image to the user.
